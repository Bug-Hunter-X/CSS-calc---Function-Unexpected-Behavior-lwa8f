The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS.  However, using it with percentages can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you don't fully understand how it interacts with the containing element's dimensions.

For example:
```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

In this scenario, `50%` is calculated relative to the *width* of the *parent* element, *then* 10px is subtracted.  If the parent element doesn't have a defined width or has a width that isn't explicitly stated, the calculation might not work as intended.

Another issue is nesting `calc()` expressions.  While possible, deeply nested calculations can become difficult to read and debug.  A minor syntax error can cause the entire calculation to fail silently.
